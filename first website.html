    INTERNATIONAL MARKETING


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<i>As competition for world markets intensifies, the number of companies operating solely in domestic markets is decreasing. With the increasing globalization of markets, companies find themselves unavoidably enmeshed with foreign customers, competitors and suppliers, even within their own borders.
Or, to put it another way, <em> it is increasingly true that the business of any business is international business.</em> The challenge of international marketing is to develop strategic plans that are competitive in the intensifying global markets. The only difference in the definitions of domestic marketing and international marketing is that marketing activities take place in more than one country. This apparently minor difference ‘. . . in more than one nation . . .’ accounts for the complexity and diversity found in international marketing operations. Marketing principles are universally applicable, whether a firm sells in the domestic market or foreign market, its marketing programs should be built around a good product or service properly priced, promoted, and distributed to a market that has to be carefully analyzed.
According to the American Marketing Association, “International Marketing is the multi-national process of planning and executing the conception, prices, promotion, and distribution of ideal goods and services to create exchanges that satisfy the individual and organizational objectives.”

The answer lies not with different concepts of marketing but with the environment within which marketing plans must be implemented. The uniqueness of international marketing comes from the range of unfamiliar problems and the variety of strategies necessary to cope with different levels of uncertainty encountered in foreign markets like competition, legal restraints, government controls, weather, etc.
Generally speaking, the marketer cannot control or influence these uncontrollable elements, but instead must adjust or adapt to them in a manner consistent with a successful outcome.</i>

    Approaches to international markets that guide the international business activities of companies can be described by one of three orientations to international marketing management. Differences in the complexity and sophistication of a company’s marketing activity depend on which orientation guides its operations.
    1 Domestic market extension concept.
    2 Multi-domestic market concept.
    3 Global marketing concept.
    
    Domestic Market Extension Concept
    The domestic company seeking sales extension of its domestic products into foreign markets illustrates this orientation to international marketing. It views its international operations as secondary to and an extension of its domestic operations; the primary motive is to market excess domestic production. Domestic business is its priority and foreign sales are seen as a profitable extension of domestic operations. Even though foreign markets may be vigorously pursued, the firm’s orientation remains basically domestic. Minimal, if any, efforts are made to adapt the marketing mix to foreign markets; the firm’s orientation is to market to foreign customers in the same manner the company markets to domestic customers. It seeks markets where demand is similar to the home market and its domestic product will be acceptable. 
    
    
    
    Multi-domestic Market Concept
    Once a company recognizes the importance of differences in overseas markets to the organization, its orientation toward international business may shift to a multi-domestic market strategy. A company guided by this concept has a strong sense that country markets are vastly different (and they may be, depending on the product) and that market success requires an almost independent program for each country. Firms with this orientation market on a country-by-country basis, with separate marketing strategies for each country.
    
    Global Marketing Concept
    A company guided by this orientation or philosophy is generally referred to as a global company, its marketing activity is a global marketing, and its market coverage is the world. A company employing a global marketing strategy strives for efficiencies of scale by developing a standardized product, of dependable quality, to be sold at a reasonable price to a global market, that is, the same country market set throughout the world.
    With this orientation a company attempts to standardize as much of the company effort as is practical on a worldwide basis. Some decisions are viewed as applicable worldwide, while others require consideration of local influences. The world as a whole is viewed as the market and the firm develops a global marketing strategy. Eg CocaCola Company,
